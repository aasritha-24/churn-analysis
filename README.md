# Churn Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive churn analysis project that combines SQL Server data ETL, Power BI visualization, and machine learning prediction using Python. 
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn data from a telecom company, build actionable reports, and create a churn prediction model.
## Project Components
1. SQL Server ETL & Data Cleaning
- Creation of database and staging tables
- Data cleaning with handling of nulls and transforming categorical data
- Views to organize churn and join data

2. Power BI Dashboard
- Data transformation with Power Query
- Measures and calculated columns for metrics like total customers, churn rate
- Visualizations: executive summary, demographic analysis, churn reasons, services usage, and geographic distribution
- Interactive features such as tooltips and slicers

3. Machine Learning with Python
- Jupyter notebook implementing Random Forest to predict churn
- Model training, evaluation and feature importance analysis
- Integration of predicted churn profiles into Power BI dashboard
